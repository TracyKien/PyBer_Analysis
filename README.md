# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
As a new data analyst at Pyber, a ride-sharing app company, I have been assigned to perform an exploratory analysis of rideshare data to help Pyber improve accessibility and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. We will be looking at the differences in various metrics between Rural, Suburban, and Rural cities to see where there could be areas of improvement.

## Results
Here I will explain the findings of my analysis.

### The Differences By City Types

1.) The Rural city type had less drivers per rides, but the average fare per ride was significantly higher than the Urban city type where. The Urban city had more drivers than rides, but the average fare per ride and driver was significantly lower which means the company is making less money on the Urban city type. 


### The Total Fares by City Types

## Summary
Based on the data gathered for all of the different city types, I recommend that PyBer follows through with the following action items:

1.) Lower the fares for the Rural city types a slightly to appear more appealing for that areas and increase the amount of drivers.

2.) Increase the amount of drivers and the fares slightly for the Suburban city type the same. 

3.) Increase the fare for the Urban city type and decrease the amount of driveres for the city type. There are too many drivers than there are rides which is costing the company money.
