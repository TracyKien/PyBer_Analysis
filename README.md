# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
As a new data analyst at Pyber, a ride-sharing app company, I have been assigned to perform an exploratory analysis of rideshare data to help Pyber improve accessibility and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. We will be looking at the differences in various metrics between Rural, Suburban, and Rural cities to see where there could be areas of improvement.

### The Differences Between Number of Rides for Each City Type

### The Differences Between Number of Drivers for Each City Type

### The Differences Between Sum of Fares for Each City Type

## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

## Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
